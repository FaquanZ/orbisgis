	New dbase driver:
		More memory friendly
		25% faster at reading
		2000% faster at writing

	New Shapefile driver:
		25% faster at reading
		small performance improvement at writing
		now fully writes and reads 3d shapefiles

	Fixed a bug when committing files. It called twice the driver close()
		method

	Metadata operations are included in the command stack so can be
		undone and redone as any other editing operation

	Metadata operations data is stored at disk

	Removed dependencies from geotools-referencing

	Refactoring of tests.
		Now it's easier to include data in the test suite
		Fixed memory problems on some tests

	PostgreSQL/PostGIS driver

	Fixed a bug that makes the shapefile driver write files like
		myshp..dbf instead of myshp.dbf

	Created a set of test cases in the org.gdms.manual.DocumentationExamples class
		to show the usage of the API

	Database driver refactoring. Now DBDrivers can extend DefaultDBDriver that
		implements lot of the methods in a JDBC standard way. DefaultDBDriver
		also extends DefaultSQL that implement a lot of methods in a SQL standard
		way.

	If the DataSource is retrieved with the STATUS_CHECK mode the read only and
		auto-increment fields are not modifiable. It still fails if a modifiable
		primary key is edited and changed to an existing value
