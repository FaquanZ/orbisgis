 * The GDMS library (Generic Datasource Management System)

 * specifications, it provides a complete and robust API to manipulate
 * in a SQL way remote DBMS (PostgreSQL, H2...) or flat files (.shp,
 * .csv...). It is produced by the "Atelier SIG" team of
 * the IRSTV Institute <http://www.irstv.fr/> CNRS FR 2488.
