/**
 * The GDMS library (Generic Datasource Management System)
 * is a middleware dedicated to the management of various kinds of
 * data-sources such as spatial vectorial data or alphanumeric. Based
 * on the JTS library and conform to the OGC simple feature access
 * specifications, it provides a complete and robust API to manipulate
 * in a SQL way remote DBMS (PostgreSQL, H2...) or flat files (.shp,
 * .csv...). It is produced by the "Atelier SIG" team of
 * the IRSTV Institute <http://www.irstv.fr/> CNRS FR 2488.
